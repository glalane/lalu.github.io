   <div class="terms-text">
      <h2><span>1.</span> Can i get Lalu supplements where i live?</h2>
      
         <p>Yes! we ship worldwide!</p><br>

      <h2><span>2.</span> Do I need insurance, or can I pay for birth control myself?</h2>

         <p>We accept both insurance and credit card payments.</p>
      <div class="faqtext"> 
         <p class="faq-text1"><span>If you want to pay with a credit card:</span> We accept all major credit cards and work closely with drug companies in order to offer you the lowest pricing on the market. We’re happy to provide you with a price quote.</p>
         <p><span>If you have insurance:</span> Most birth control is fully covered by insurance, and you will not owe anything. However, some birth control medications do require a copay, and even if you have insurance, you will be responsible for paying for the copay. We will let you know ahead of time if you have a copay. We accept all major insurance plans, including Medi-CAL and Family PACT in California. We also accept select Medicaid plans in certain states. You can also use your FSA/HSA cards.</p>
      </div>  

          <p>Please note: If you're part of a closed network health plan, such as Kaiser California or Independent Physician Association, you will need to see a provider within that network to obtain a prescription and must continue to fill at pharmacies within that network unless you pay with credit card/cash.</p><br>

      <h2><span>3.</span> Is The Pill Club’s packaging discreet?</h2>

         <p>Yes! Along with free shipping, we send your supplements prescription in a discreet envelope without any logos or company info. The return address simply states “TPC” so no-one will know what’s inside.</p><br>

      <h2><span>4.</span> What do I do if I'm experiencing side effects?</h2>


         <p>Experiencing some spotting and breakthrough bleeding? Don’t worry. This is a common side effect of using birth control. Please keep in mind that it can take some time for your body to adjust to the change in hormones. Each person’s experience with birth control may be different. Check out the list of common side effects shown below. Our medical team suggests sticking to any new birth control for 2 to 3 months before switching brands, unless you have intolerable side effects.</p>

        <p> Please see your primary care provider or reach out to one of our pharmacists (650) 562-7271 for concerns about common side effects. You may also text us at 44872 to discuss common side effects.</p>

        <p> Although rare, serious side effects may occur. If you experience any of the following symptoms, immediately go to the nearest Emergency Room or call 911.</p>
